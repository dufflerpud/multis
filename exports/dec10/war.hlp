            WAR is a multi-user game written by Chris Caldwell
     with considerable input from Roger Long and some Macro-10
     assembly coding by Robert Kenney at the University of New Hampshire.  
     
     To run the game under Tops10, type in:
     
             .R GAM:WAR -switch /switch /switch . . .
     
     where "switch" is can be:
     
       A terminal type:
         ADDS580         for use on ADDS580 terminals
         ADM3A           for use on ADM3A terminals
         VT52            for use on DEC scopes
         ISC             for use on the ISC graphic terminal
         ISCBIG          for use with A7 mode on the ISC graphics terminal
         PE550           for use on PERKINS ELMER terminals
         ADDS980         for use on ADDS980 terminals
         ACTV            for use on ACT-V terminals
         ADVANT          for use with North Star ADVANTage terminals
         ANSI            for use on any ANSI terminal (now with color!)
                         When in doubt, use ANSI.
     
       OLDANG            use 0"=East, 90"=North, 180"=West, 270"=South
       		    Otherwise 0"=North, 90"=East, 180"=South, 270"=West
     
     If you don't specify a terminal type, you will be prompted for one.
     If you don't specify /OLDANG, the normal compass rose of 0"-means-
     North will be used instead of the old (incorrect) 0"-means-East
     system.
     
          WAR is a multi-user simulation based loosely  on  the  final
     battle scene of THE NEW HOPE in the STAR WARS series.

          WAR will then ask you for the character  to  represent  your
     ship on the sensor displays.  A-M will make you a rebel ship, N-Z
     will make you an empire ship.

          The display for WAR is very simple.  In the upper  right  of
     the  screen is the time (in minutes and seconds) before the Death
     Star destroys the Rebel Base, and the rest of the  display  is  a
     low  resolution picture of what you would see out of the front of
     your ship.

          The  playing  area  is  100  units  wide   on   the   X-axis
     (coordinates -50 to 50), 100 units wide on the Y-axis (-75 to 25)
     and 28 units deep on the Z-axis (-3 to 25).  The surface  of  the
     Death  Star is at altitude zero.  The exhaust port is at location
     (0,0,-2) and the trench (3 units deep and wide) goes  from  (0,0)
     to  (0,-75).  There are light and heavy lazer guns scattered over
     the surface which will fire at rebel ships.

          As a rebel,  you  must  start  out  from  somewhere  between
     (-50,-75)  to  (-50,25),  pilot your ship to somewhere around the
     beginning of the trench (0,-75),  down  the  trench  and  fire  a
     proton-torpedo  down  the  exhaust  port.   Then  in  order to be
     completely successful, you must pull out of the trench and  leave
     the playing area before the Death Star explodes.

          As a member of the empire, you must start out from somewhere
     between   (50,-75)   to  (50,25)  and  prevent  any  rebels  from
     destroying the Death Star before  the  Death  Star  destroys  the
     Rebel Base.


     COMMANDS:

     <         Roll the ship counter-clockwise one degree/S^2
     >         Roll the ship clockwise one degree/S^2
     T         Fire proton-torpedo (rebels have two, empire has none)
     0         Fire lazer-gun
