             RISK is a multi-user game written by Chris Caldwell
     with considerable input from Roger Long and some Macro-10
     assembly coding by Robert Kenney at the University of New Hampshire.  
     
     To run the game under Tops10, type in:
     
             .R GAM:RISK -switch
     
     where "switch" is a terminal type:
         ADDS580         for use on ADDS580 terminals
         ADM3A           for use on ADM3A terminals
         VT52            for use on DEC scopes
         ISC             for use on the ISC graphic terminal
         ISCBIG          for use with A7 mode on the ISC graphics terminal
         PE550           for use on PERKINS ELMER terminals
         ADDS980         for use on ADDS980 terminals
         ACTV            for use on ACT-V terminals
         ADVANT          for use with North Star ADVANTage terminals
         ANSI            for use on any ANSI terminal (now with color!)
                         When in doubt, use ANSI.
     
     If you don't specify a terminal type, you will be prompted for one.

          When RISK has ascertained  what  terminal  type  you  are
     using,  if you are the first person entering the game, it  will
     prompt  you  for  the  number of players who will be playing.
     The program will then wait until all the number of specified
     people run the game before drawing the screens on all of their
     terminals.

          If you only specify one player, the computer will create
     a second player which it will control - though it puts up only
     a modest fight.

          The screen drawn is a (very) low resolution map of the
     world divided up into 26 sections labeled A through Z.

          If a player has armies located in a region, next to the
     region letter will be the number of armies followed by the player
     letter.  You know which player you are by looking down on the
     lower section of the screen, which shows you how many armies
     you have as well.

          When a player enters the game, he is given 10 armies in
     a random region.  The object of the game is to have at least one
     army on every region of the board.

          The commands are non-echoing characters.  They are

          E - Exit RISK
          N - Draw a new screen
          nab - Move "n" armies from region "a" to region "b".

          So, say, if you had 10 armies in region W and you wanted
     to move 4 of them to region X, you would type "4WX" followed
     by the return key.  Note that (unlike the board game) it takes
     time to move an army from one region to another.  You can
     continue to enter as many movement commands as you want, as
     fast as you can type them, but eventually all that will do for
     you is make all of your armies be in transit for awhile.  The
     armies that are in transit will appear on the upper right hand
     screen along with the amount of time until they arrive in their
     new region.

          If one or more armies arrives at a region which has
     armies from another player, they have a battle using the traditional
     dice-odds from the board game.  Consequently, only one player's
     armies will end up in the region.

          Occasionally, (every 200 game clock ticks), the program
     will increase the number of armies at most of the occupied
     locations on the board.  This means, it is to a player's
     advantage to have armies on as many regions as possible, but
     of course, the fewer armies he has on a region, the more easily
     he can be defeated by an attack from another player.

          Play continues until all the regions on the board are
     occupied by one player or everyone has exited the game.
